## Getting Started

Getting started is pretty simple. You will navigate to the deployted url and in the Seach page you can type any book titles that are of interest.
Once you see something you'd like to save you can click on the "Save" button to save the book for later. The Saved page is a historical view of books that have been saved. You can remove them from the list by clicking on the "x"
